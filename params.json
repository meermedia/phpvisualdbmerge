{"name":"Php Visual DB Merge","tagline":"Tool to visually merge two databases and download the result, built for PHP and MySQL.","body":"### Welcome to PHP Visual DB Merge.\r\n\r\nThis tool will help you two merge two databases (for example a deployment and production database). Unlike other export/import tools or mysqldump commands, this tool will show you exactly which tables there are, match them up side by side, and let you select which table will be taken from which side. You can also skip certain tables or just use empty tables (avoids having to clear cache tables afterwards).\r\n\r\nIf you are a Drupal user, you will be happy to know that I have pre-installed some presets for Drupal 6 and Drupal 7(8), and also an intelligent 'auto' mode. The auto-mode should also work for WordPress websites.\r\n\r\nSimply download the zip-file or clone our git-repository by using the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_web_root\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/meermedia/phpvisualdbmerge.git .\r\n$ git pull\r\n$ cp sample.config.php config.php\r\n$ vi config.php (type :wq to write and exit)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nContact the author if you have any questions or requests: @meermedia\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nHaving trouble with PHP Visual DB Merge?
